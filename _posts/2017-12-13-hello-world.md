I'm Hoang Nam and a Java Developer. I will show a Example for Code...

Example:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Nam')
#=> prints 'Hi, Nam' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Example:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Example:

{% highlight java %}
/******************************************************************************
 *  Compilation:  javac HelloWorld.java
 *  Execution:    java HelloWorld
 *
 *  Prints "Hello, World". By tradition, this is everyone's first program.
 *
 *  % java HelloWorld
 *  Hello, World
 *
 *  These 17 lines of text are comments. They are not part of the program;
 *  they serve to remind us about its properties. The first two lines tell
 *  us what to type to compile and test the program. The next line describes
 *  the purpose of the program. The next few lines give a sample execution
 *  of the program and the resulting output. We will always include such 
 *  lines in our programs and encourage you to do the same.
 *
 ******************************************************************************/

public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window.
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }

}
